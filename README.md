### What is a Dead drop?

Dead Drops are an anonymous, offline, peer to peer file-sharing network in public space. USB flash drives are embedded into walls, buildings and curbs accessible to anybody in public space. 

For more info on Deap Drops, and the origin story: http://deaddrops.com/

##You don't need any technical knowledge to participate, just create your piece and we will set up the drive and place it for you if needed!

###What
Art Drop Louisville is an experiment that will feature local artists of all types (music, visual, game, food, writing, anything). 
Each Artist will provide an exclusive creation and a description  on a flash drive and  we will put it in a public space for anyone to find and enjoy.

###Why
To promote awesome local artists and to showcase the creativity here in our diverse city.

###Where
Locations that promote unique & interesting places in Louisville that people may have never been.
For example, places with a beautiful view, interesting piece of architecture, or near a great local restaurant.

###When
Creation needs to be completed by July 27th at 4pm , contact us to get involved and get help with any part of the process, or submit your dead drop location to melissabezuska@gmail.com


###Rules:
The only rules are:
- Exclusive art! nobody can have a way to see/hear/experience the piece other than the USB drive
- Louisville themed or connection

>Every type of art, any type of artist, Louisville show what you can do!

###Ideas:

* Spoken word track
* Photography
* Photo of a painting
* Sewing or embroidery pattern
* Digital art piece
* Game or interactive experience
* Music recording
* Poetry
* Recipe
* Joke or Louisville themed meme
* Story or article
* Anything you can think of, Louisville is home to some of the most creative individuals!

On Sunday July 27th, 2014 at 4pm, we will all gather together to share our creations with one another and format each flash drive.  At this point we will then split up and place the dead drops around the city.  

The location of a single dead drop will them be posted on twitter, facebook, reddit, etc for the public to find and each subsequent flash drive will contain the location of another dead drop until all are found.  

Please contact Melissa or Alex at melissabezuska@gmail.com with any questions or concerns.
